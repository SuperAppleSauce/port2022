        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>Lawyers have unusually high rates of mental illnesses such as alcoholism, substance abuse, and chronic depression.How might we provide a wellness solution to lawyers who are facing mental health issues?</p>
    <ol> 
        <li>Lawyers are 3.6 times more likely to suffer from depression compared to the average </li>
        <li><p>32% of lawyers under 30 are problem drinkers.</p></li>
        <li><p>$800K Yearly cost related to mental health at 1000 lawyer firm </p></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Interview learnings</h2>
    <p>
        To develop a few ideas, we conducted addtiontal inteviews to learn more about lawyer assistance programs (LAPs) and their effectiveness. We conducted 100 interviews where we learned that peer focused solutions AAA and 12-step programs have low attendance and minimal long term effectiveness because of:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Perceived little value for lawyers who believed their conditions werenâ€™t severe</li>
    <li><p>Too few follow-up opportunities and little accountability for improvement</p></li>
</ol>

        <h2>Testing intial ideas</h2>
    <p>Our first idea was to make an app that lawyers could use in parallel to LAP meetings help to reduce inconveniences and create accountability. We would increase accountability by introducing a virtual assistant to help with difficult concepts. We also chose to include bite-sized tasks for lawyers to complete at any pace to help reduce time concerns.To test our whether our idea was viable, I created a series of low fidelity wireframes. Which we shared with lawyers, wellness experts, and LAP organizers</p>

    <h2>Testing findings</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lawyers were curious to see what other users were doing in the app. This is because LAP meetings usually have in-person participants who can offer additional perspectives.</li>
        <li>A purely AI guided experience didn't resonate well with lawyers</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing intial ideas</h2>
<p>
    In our most recent iteration, we've decided to lean further into the peer to peer aspects of wellness to emulate the in-person LAP meetings. We also chose to reduce the presence of the virtual assistant. In addition to incorporating feedback from lawyers; we spent time learning from wellness experts about measuring an individual's progress as they use the app.
